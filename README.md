# MKS (and OSE) addons for Kerbal Planetary Base Systems

This is a simple set of compatablity patches enabling MKS support in Kerbal Planetary Base Systems.  Currently it focuses on two specific MKS mechanics: Wear and Logistics.  In addition it enables rudimentary support for OSE Workshops.

## Additional Parts:

These patches add the following parts:

- An inline workbench
- An end-unit workbench
- Containers for MaterialKits, SpecializedParts,  (Small and large.)

Both workbenches are simple clones of the airlocks, and have OSE workshop support, as well as MKS autorepair support.  The end-units are slightly more productive than the inline units.

The new containers are clones of the fuel tanks, and get appropriate logistics.  (See below.)

## Logistics:

The following logistics are added:

- Warehouses to all container tanks.
- Distributed Warehouses to all large container tanks.
- Consumer support to FuelCell, Algae, and Greenhouse tanks.
- Power coupler support to the Central Hub and the Inline Control Center.

## Future Plans

These patches really need to add livingSpace and workSpace where appropriate.
