# UKS (and OSE/EL) addons for Kerbal Planetary Base Systems

This is a simple set of compatablity patches enabling UKS support in Kerbal Planetary Base Systems.  Currently it focuses on two specific UKS mechanics: Wear and Logistics.  In addition it enables rudimentary support for OSE Workshops and Extraplanetary Launchpads.

## Additional Parts:

These patches add the following parts:

- An inline workbench
- An end-unit workbench
- Containers for MaterialKits, SpecializedParts, and RocketParts.  (Small and large.)

Both workbenches are simple clones of the airlocks, and have EL+OSE workshop support, as well as UKS autorepair support.  The end-units are slightly more productive than the inline units.

The new containers are clones of the fuel tanks, and get appropriate logistics.  (See below.)  RocketParts will only show with EL and not UKS, while the others will show up with either UKS or OSE.

## Extraplanetary Launchpads Support

In addition to the parts above, these patches add Survey Station capability (and modest productivity) to the Central Hub and Cupola.

## Logistics:

The following logistics are added:

- Warehouses to all container tanks.
- Distributed Warehouses to all large container tanks.
- Planetary Distribution support to the large fuel tank.
- Consumer support to FuelCell, Algae, and Greenhouse tanks.
- Consumer support to all crewed parts.
- Power coupler support to the Central Hub and the Inline Control Center.

## Future Plans

These patches really need to add livingSpace and workSpace where appropriate.
